I am a student with a strong interest in software engineering. It has been my pleasure to use GitHub for the last few months to gain a better understanding of version control and collaboration tools. As a proficient user of GitHub, I am capable of creating repositories, managing branches, and submitting pull requests. Additionally, I am familiar with the GitHub ecosystem and can use it to locate and use open-source software.

I am confident that my skills in GitHub will be of value to my studies and to my future career. As a quick learner, I am always eager to take on new challenges. Furthermore, I am a team player and I am always willing to assist others.

As an expert html and css scripter, I believe that GitHub is an invaluable tool, and I am confident that I will be able to use it to learn and grow.
